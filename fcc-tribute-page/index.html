    <h3 >The rise of the "Diamond"</h3>
    <p>Dekkers was born on 4 September 1969 in Breda, Netherlands. He began learning martial arts at age 12.In the beginning of his career Dekkers' manager was Clovis Depretz, the manager of legendary Rob Kaman. This was the reason why Kaman was at ringside during many of Dekkers' matches, including his farewell fight. They often trained together and became good friends. Dekkers and Kaman were dubbed by fight fans in Thailand as "The Double Dutch duo".</p>
      <p>In his first fight at 16 years of age, Dekkers won in a spectacular knockout against a well-established older boxer. Although, only weighing about 55 kg, his opponents found out sooner rather than later he was much stronger than he looked. As Dekkers kept on winning his matches by knockout, his reputation of an as up-and-coming fighter spread in the Muay Thai community. He was awarded his first title at age 18, when he won the MTBN Dutch Championship on 15 November 1987. Dekkers defeated Ramkisoen by knockout with a high kick. Previous to this fight the Dutchman had his first international contest against the reigning European champion, Richard Nam of France. Dekkers lost the fight on points. They would rematch each other a year later for the EMTA European Championship. This time Dekkers won the fight by knockout with a left hook, cross to body combination in the fourth round.</p>

        <h3>Fame and glory in Thailand</h3>
      <p>Ramon Dekkers fought some of the best fighters Thailand had to offer. Especially in the beginning it was hard for Dekkers to fight at full Thai rules. The scoring methods were different than he was used to in Europe. "In Thailand it is very difficult to win other than by knocking your opponent out. It has happened to me in many of my fights that I have lost on "points" while fighting in Thailand. It's normal over there losing on points but it can be very frustrating.", Dekkers stated in an interview in 1993. Dekkers also blamed some of his losses to his many injuries. Despite his defeats the Thai fight fans had a great respect for Dekkers' determination and ability.</p>

      <h3>Royal recognition</h3>
  <p>On the occasion of the 85th anniversary of the King of Thailand, Dekkers received a royal award from the Thai Royal Family for his services to the sport. The Dutchman was also appointed ambassador of all foreign fighters in Thailand. "This is very important to me. It is the greatest recognition that I can get for what I have achieved in this sport," said Dekkers, after the presentation by the Thai princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, the eldest daughter of King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</p>
